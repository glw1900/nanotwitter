Note: All the tests are "clients per minute". We know it is better to the third method -- "maintain client load". But we did not know that it is better. And, to compare with previous results, we still use the "clients per minute" for now, but we added the "maintain client load" test statistics since the tests with Redis.
Important:  Please use "/test/reset" before any loader.io tests. Thank You!!
