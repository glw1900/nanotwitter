We noticed that most twitters might not have comments, therefore there is no need to query in the comments table every time. Then we labeled every tweet as 1 or 0, when tweets are created, the label is set to 0, then if a comment is made, we change the label to 1. Thus every time we first check the label of a twitter, if itâ€™s labeled 0 then we check in the comment table.\r\n\r\n### Screen Shot\r\n![](http://postimg.org/image/lqxj6uyy3/)\r\n![](http://postimg.org/image/3jo69ifr5/)\r\n![](http://postimg.org/image/7op0ox0mb/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Interesting Engineering!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
