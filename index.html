<p>This is our Huge Twitter github page, we have supported a lot of functionalities of the original twitter and we are still moving on, including posting twitter, timeline, following, unfollowing, commenting, retweet.</p>

<p>Please visit our website at http:/hugetwitter.herokuapp.com, and register, have fun!</p>

<a id="technology-description" class="anchor" href="#technology-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technology Description</h3>

<p>This App is built on Ruby Sinatra with ActiveRcord and a psql database. All the tests are written with MiniTest. We also adopted New Relic as our performance management tool.</p>

<p>We adopt redis to cache data that requires comparatively high cost in querying in database and yet are requested frequently, such as 50 most recent twitters and timeline of recent login users.</p>

<p>WeBrick and Puma: We use WeBrick for the server, because the Puma is actually slower in our server.</p>

<p>Read into comments table for every twitter is quite a cost. We noticed that most twitters might not have comments, therefore there is no need to query in the comments table every time. Then we labeled every tweet as 1 or 0, when tweets are created, the label is set to 0, then if a comment is made, we change the label to 1. Thus every time we first check the label of a twitter, if it’s labeled 0 then we check in the comment table.</p>

<p>In addiction to the requirement, We implemented commenting and retweeting.</p>
